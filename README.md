<h1> Bounty </h1>

<p> 
  Bounty is a web app developed on the Ruby on Rails framework and utilizes the Materialize CSS framework for the front end. This app was creatd during the 36 hour UofT Hacks IV hackathon. The purpose of this web app was to allow individuals to make some spare income on the side doing favours that are dependent on their locations. "Runners", individuals willing to do favours, will create a post that will include their location, duration of time they will be there, and the radius they're willing to travel apart from their original location. "Buyers", users looking for favours, will be able to browse and search posts based location to find a relevant post. Once found, buyers can submit a request which the runners can accept/decline. If the request is accepted, the runner will purchase and deliver the item to the specified meeting location and will received a % comission off the total price of the item.
